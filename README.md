# SomaliSeaTrace

**SomaliSeaTrace** is a blockchain-based web application designed to enhance traceability in Somaliaâ€™s fisheries supply chain. Built for a pilot in Bosaso, it allows fishers to log catches, processors to verify and process them, and buyers to confirm provenance via an Ethereum blockchain. The app leverages QR codes and a modern UI to combat illegal fishing and boost export credibility.

---

## Features

- **Fisher Catch Logging**: Fishers log catches (species, weight, location) with automatic QR code generation.
- **Processor Verification**: Processors search catches by ID, add processing details (e.g., "Frozen"), and update records.
- **Buyer Verification**: Buyers input catch IDs to retrieve and verify details from the blockchain.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Catches are stored immutably on a local Ethereum network (Ganache).
- **Offline Support**: Uses IndexedDB for local storage, syncing when online.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v16+ (includes npm).
- **Ganache**: Local Ethereum blockchain ([install guide](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)).
- **Remix IDE**: For contract deployment ([remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/)).
- **Browser**: Modern browser (e.g., Chrome) with geolocation enabled.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd somali-sea-trace

2. Install Dependencies

Client
cd client
npm install

Server
cd server
npm install


3. Set Up Ethereum Blockchain
Run Ganache:
ganache

Note the RPC URL (http://127.0.0.1:8545) and first account address.
Deploy Smart Contract:
Open server/contracts/CatchStorage.sol in Remix IDE.
Compile (Solidity 0.8.x).
Deploy to Ganache (Web3 Provider, http://127.0.0.1:8545).
Copy the deployed contract address (e.g., 0x123...) and ABI (from "Compilation Details").
Update Server:
Edit server/index.js:

const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress"; // From Remix
const contractABI = [ /* Your ABI from Remix */ ];
const account = "0xYourAccountAddress"; // First Ganache 0xYourAccountAddress

Update Client:
Edit client/src/components/BuyerPage.jsx:

const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress"; // Match server
const contractABI = [ /* Your ABI from Remix */ ];

Running the Application
Start Ganache:
ganache

Start Server:
cd server
npm start
Runs on http://localhost:5001.

Start Client:
cd client
npm run dev
Opens at http://localhost:5174 (or similar).

Usage
Fisher (Home Page)
URL: http://localhost:5174/
Action: Select species, enter weight, submit. A QR code appears with the catch ID.
Sync: Catches sync to the blockchain every minute (check server logs for tx hashes).

Processor
URL: http://localhost:5174/processor
Action: Enter a catch ID (from QR), search, select processing type (e.g., "Frozen"), verify.
Sync: Updates sync to the blockchain.

Buyer
URL: http://localhost:5174/buyer
Action: Enter a catch ID, verify. Displays blockchain-stored details if found.

Development Notes
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Web3.js, React Router.
Backend: Node.js, Express, Web3.js.
Blockchain: Ethereum (Ganache), Solidity.
Storage: IndexedDB for offline caching, Ethereum for permanent records.

Extending the App
QR Scanning: Add html5-qrcode for camera-based QR reading.
Dashboard: Create a /dashboard route for analytics (e.g., catch stats).
Production: Replace Ganache with a testnet (e.g., Sepolia) and secure API keys.
